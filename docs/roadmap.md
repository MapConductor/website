MapConductor is still in an early but active stage. Our short‑term priority is to make the Android SDK stable and practical for real projects, while keeping the API simple enough for beginners.

## Short‑term goals (in progress)

- Harden the Android SDK and improve the developer experience.
- Expand and refine support for Google Maps, Mapbox, ArcGIS, HERE, and MapLibre.
- Provide clear tutorials and examples for common general‑purpose location‑based applications.

## Medium‑term goals

- Prototype an iOS SDK with a similar unified API.
- Explore additional map overlays and interactive features.
- Design high‑level cloud concepts for data synchronization and geofencing, without locking developers into any single provider.

## Community and funding

This project started as a personal effort based on real‑world experience building map apps, and is currently supported by the Mitou Advanced (未踏アドバンスト) program in Japan, operated by the Information‑technology Promotion Agency (IPA), a governmental organization.

Looking ahead, we are applying to NLnet’s Mobifree programme to help grow MapConductor as a public, open‑source building block in the mobile ecosystem.

Today, the Android SDK is already released and used in demo applications, with the next version planned soon. During the Mobifree funding period we plan to further stabilise the Android SDK and develop an iOS SDK (and, if possible, a Flutter SDK), including advanced features such as marker clustering and raster/vector tile rendering.

Funding would also support outreach and community building: speaking at events around the world, running community activities such as bug‑hunting or contributor recognition, and creating space for new contributors to join the core development.

We want MapConductor to be sustainable as a community project. That means clear governance, transparent decision‑making, and an environment where contributions from many people are welcome.
