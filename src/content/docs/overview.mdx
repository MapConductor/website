MapConductor is an open-source middleware SDK that lets you work with multiple map SDKs through a unified programming model.

Instead of learning and rewriting code for each map provider, you can focus on building location-based experiences using a consistent API.

---

## The Problem

Building map applications often means dealing with multiple SDKs — each with different APIs, behaviors, and design concepts.


<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![You are stuck on building a map application](~/assets/overview/en/1.png)</div>
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Why is making a map app this hard? It should be easier...](~/assets/overview/en/2.png)</div>
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Different syntax, different behavior..., this is too hard!](~/assets/overview/en/3.png)</div>
</div>

Even simple features require relearning how each SDK works.  
As projects grow, switching providers or supporting multiple platforms becomes increasingly complex.

---

## One Syntax for Every Map SDK

MapConductor introduces a unified layer between your application and map SDKs.

<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Ta-da!](~/assets/overview/en/4.png)</div>
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Looks like you're stuck. I'm MapConductor.](~/assets/overview/en/5.png)</div>
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![I help map SDKs speak the same language!](~/assets/overview/en/6.png)</div>
</div>

It provides a shared programming model that allows map SDKs to be handled in the same way.

Your application interacts with MapConductor — MapConductor handles the differences.

---

## Write Once, Use Any Map SDK

With MapConductor, the same application logic can work across supported map SDKs.

<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![With MapConductor, you can use any map SDK with the same syntax.](~/assets/overview/en/7.png)</div>
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Wait! So, I can use the same code for Google Maps and Mapbox?](~/assets/overview/en/8.png)</div>
</div>

You write map features once using a unified API, while MapConductor adapts behavior to each underlying SDK.

This reduces implementation differences without hiding platform capabilities.

---

## Built for Real Map Development

MapConductor is not just a thin wrapper.  
It builds on shared concepts across map SDKs and adds practical capabilities designed for real applications.

<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Markers, polylines, camera controls, events - you can do it all!](~/assets/overview/en/9.png)</div>
</div>

Supported features include:
- Markers and info bubbles (annotations)
- Polylines and polygons
- Camera control
- Event handling
- Clustering and visualization utilities
- High-performance rendering extensions

---

## A Better Developer Experience

When APIs behave consistently, development becomes simpler and more predictable.

<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Wow! The same code works! This makes development so much easier!](~/assets/overview/en/10.png)</div>
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Whoa! This is so easy! I can even do this!](~/assets/overview/en/11.png)</div>
</div>

Developers can focus on application logic instead of SDK-specific implementation details.

---

## One Mental Model Across Platforms

MapConductor extends the same development approach across platforms.

<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![And it gets even better - the same code works on iOS and Android!](~/assets/overview/en/12.png)</div>
</div>

The same concepts can be used with modern UI frameworks such as:

- Jetpack Compose (Android)
- SwiftUI (iOS)

This reduces cognitive overhead when building cross-platform map applications.

---

## Simple, Flexible, Practical

MapConductor allows you to choose the map SDK that fits your needs while keeping development consistent and maintainable.

<div class="flex flex-wrap manga">
  <div class="flex-1" style="margin: 0px;">![Pretty simple, right?](~/assets/overview/en/13.png)</div>
</div>

Whether you stay with a single provider or support multiple ones, MapConductor helps you build map applications more efficiently.
